Analysis:


What kinds of file lead to lots of compressions? 
Files that contain a lot of repetitive values lead to a lot of compression. In other words, files that were large in size typically had more compression compared to smaller files as it tended to contain more repetitive values. Also, text files such as txt or htm lead to a lot of compression, on average 40% compression. This is because text files tend to contain  more redundant characters than other types of file, which means that the file can be compressed for efficiency.  


What kind of files had little or no compression?
Small sized files may not only lead to no compression, it could also lead to a larger file size due to the header information. This is especially true when the file is using the count header format as there would be 256 integers representing the frequency of each possible 8 bit value. Also, image files such as tif lead to little compression, on average 18% compression. This is because image files are already highly compressed already, which means that it is inefficient to compress the file.




What happens when you try and compress a huffman code file?
When compressing multiple times in general, it eventually reaches a point where compressing becomes inefficient as it creates a larger file than the previous unhuff file. This is because compression reduces redundancy and when you try to compress after reaching a point where there is not any redundancy left, it will do the opposite and create more data in the process. On large files, compressing more than once can lead to more bits being saved, but all files eventually reach a point where no bits are saved, in fact the file size increases instead.
